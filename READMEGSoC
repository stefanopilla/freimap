Service Discovery in Mesh Networks / Avahi DataSource for freimap 

Hi,

I've changed my PC on July so I've lost all of my SVN data…

Fortunately, I've made a backup of my Netbeans Project but I've lost all of my previous SVN commit…
So I send you all of my Sources code but not SVN files…

Some files are part of existing freimap software of Freifunk Project (that is my Organization), not all of these files are used. However in the tar file there are 3 directories:

SRC that contains all of my sources files:
	- freimapgsoc is the main package where there are a major part of 	my application
	- data that contains an xml file for representations of the node on 	the map
	- PopUp that is another package of Freimap Software
	
TEST is a test directory (the files are not principal for the application)

NBPROJECT that contains all important information for Netbeans.

I haven't included LIB Directory because it is about of 8 Mbyte…

However the library that you need are:
jcommon-1.0.8.jar
jfreechart-1.0.4
jmdns
mysql-connector-java-5.0.5-bin
swing-worker
swingx-bean
swingx-ws-2009_06_14
swingx
xpp3_min-1.1.4c
xstream-1.2.2-20061111.171510-1
appframework-1.0.3
swing-worker-1.1
org-netbeans-modules-java-j2seproject-copylibstask

You also need of Java JDK 1.6 or higher.

All others files are Netbeans's files so there aren't important information about my work...

More info about my development process and  are here: http://wiki.freifunk.net/Freimap

There is also a simply LOG of my work in logGSoC file but it is a general description of my work…

If you need some explanations contact me at pillastefano@gmail.com

Thanks a lot!

Pilla Stefano
